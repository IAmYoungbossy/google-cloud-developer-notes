<h1>Welcome To My Google Cloud Developer Notes</h1>

<h2>Intro about me</h2>

<P>Hello, I am Letam Bossman Barinua, a Full Stack Developer based in Port Harcourt. In my quest to continually add to my skill set and make myself more useful for my employer, I have decided to be an all round developer by following the Google Cloud Developer learning path while I continue to work remotely as a Full Stack Developer. I believe this would be a valuable skill as the company I work for uses GCP products and services.</P>
